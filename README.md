# Computer Security 327 Course Project

## Program:
  Take a user password and with the help of machine learning (Perceptron) categorizes the given password as strong or weak. If the password is weak the program will give a suggestion on how to improve the password to move it into the strong category. If a user account is made it will hash the password chosen and say if this is a unique password for this user. If the password is found to not be unique the program will tell the user to come up with a different password.
  

## Input:
  Password from User under consideration.
  
## Output: 
  Yes use the password. No change the password (already used or not strong enough).
